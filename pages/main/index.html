                <h3>About the shelter “Cozy House”</h3>
                <p id="about-up-par">Currently we have 
                    121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands 
                    and statistics show that only 20% 
                    of them will find a family. The others 
                    will continue to live with us and will 
                    be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.</p>
                <p id="about-bottom-par">We feed our wards with the best food and make 
                    sure that they do not get sick, feel comfortable 
                    (including psychologically) and well. We are supported 
                    by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels. 
                    About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. 
                    Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets 
                    and would hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
